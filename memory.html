      The Art of Memory was a theoretical architectural project in which students were to study the effects of memory, with an emphasis on the study of eidetic memory and images. The basis for the project was the site where the 1960's Detroit Race Riots erupted. The final product was to be a museum and archive.

      Initial models were composed of site images and plans, both past and present. Interviews from living witnesses of the riots were also used. What I began to understand was that the memory of these events was fragmented, as depicted in my models. As interesting as they were, I began to wonder what would happen when they interacted with something solid, intact, or non-fragmented. My choice was a cube, inspired by my precedent, Exeter Library by Louis Kahn. By envisioning the shredded image models with sharp images, I allowed the edges to cut the cube as they came in contact with it.

    <p class="project-description">
      The outcome was amazing. At this point in the project the time had come to begin programming the models into structures. Using what I learned about memory, I began to think about what kind of memory my model was. Solid was the first thing that came to mind, but even solid memories are attached to other passive memories. In this way, I began to fuse the solid pieces with "light" ones using glazing. The larger section in the back was nearly independent. With few glazing connections, it made sense this would be the archive, while the adjacent space would host the artifacts for public viewing.
